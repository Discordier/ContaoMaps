# ContaoMaps

ContaoMaps is a generalized map extension for displaying maps in the Contao CMS <www.contao.org>

## Supported connectors.

Currently there is only the Google Map connector semi finished.
Open Street Map and 
Bing Maps will follow as soon as there is time for it.

## Main goals in development.
The main focus is on extendability and flexibility. Therefore handling might appear a little complex to the novice but it pays back for the developer as one can create a map via code or module or whatever.
Choosing driver bindings is a simple matter of configuration settings (in addition to installation of the library of course).

## Stability notice
Please bear in mind that, despite the fact that this extension has now been underway from 2009 until now (and therefore almost 3 years) it is still a long way from being finished.
